# Security Policy

In brief, there is none. You are responsible for what you consume. This packgae is to be uesd in Markdown processing that involves Katex. I only use it in an
environment that I control to generate static web pages for my site. If you use it in a different environment than this, you should understand the risks.

## Supported 

Only the latest version of this packgae is supported and maintained, and even that is with time permitting.
